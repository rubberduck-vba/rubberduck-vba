# Rubberduck - Taking the VBE to the next milennium

Welcome to the Github-Pages of Rubberduck.

Rubberduck is a VBE Addin to help users write better, cleaner and more maintainable code.
Find out what Rubberduck is about [here](/Rubberduck/About)

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/releases/tag/Rubberduck-v2.2.0.3086) or even the latest [pre-release](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/releases).
The latest pre-release contains the newest goodies, but it's built whenever we get something new into Rubberduck.
That means some issues or not-quite-finished features could sneak their way in there.
We make a best effort that the release always works, but now and then something slips the cracks.

The latest release will always have been vetted and extensively checked.
Of course that doesn't mean it's flawless.
